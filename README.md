# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
The best way to understand an algorithm is to implement it from scratch.Here I use NumPy and SciPy to implement machine learning algorithms since all the algorithms involve linear algebra (vector, matrix) computation.

## Navie Bayes
Naive Bayes is a generative model which is calculating the probabilities for each class of the target and the probabilities of each feature given a specific class. It is based on the Bayes Therom and the    assumption that each feature is conditionally independent (that is why it is Naive).
